# Defining a linked list
A linked list is a linear data structure, whose **order** is not represented by the physical memory. Rather, it relies on each element **pointing** to the next. This allows easy insertion and deletion, at the cost of poor traversal (when compared to a [[01.arrays_and_strings-CTCI]]).

There are three common ways to represent a linked list.

## Singly Linked List 
Each element only points to the next.

- [ ] A delete method -> Copy over the next element, to current and remove the next element. 
## Doubly Linked List
Each elements also has a pointer to point to the previous element.

## Circular Linked List.
The tail of the linked list points to the head.
